*Aquatica* is a modern tropical adventure inspired by mods like [Tropicraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tropicraft). 
Unlike previous takes on this idea, Aquatica provides a new twist: you are stranded on an Aquatic
island, and have to survive in this environment from the very start. Scavenge for resources, fight off pirates,
scuba-dive for goodies, and build your civilization in this world-type tropical mod.
